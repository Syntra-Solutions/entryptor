```

## Notes for AI Assistants

### Task Management Guidelines
1. **Always check this file** before starting work to understand current priorities
2. **Add new tasks discovered** during implementation to "Discovered During Work"
3. **Mark tasks complete** immediately when finished
4. **Update task status** if you make progress but don't complete
5. **Add context** when marking complete - what was learned, what changed, etc.

### When Working on Tasks
- Reference the task number/description in commit messages
- If a task becomes more complex, break it into subtasks
- If you discover dependencies, note them in the task
- If you find blockers, move task to "Blocked Tasks" section
